  abstract={High dimensional structured data enriched model describes groups of observations by shared and per-group individual parameters, each with its own structure such as sparsity or group sparsity. In this paper, we consider the general form of data enrichment where data comes in a fixed but arbitrary number of groups G.  Any convex function, e.g., norms, can characterize the structure of both shared and individual parameters. We propose an estimator for high dimensional data enriched model and provide conditions under which it consistently estimates both shared and individual parameters. We also delineate sample complexity of the estimator and present high probability non-asymptotic bound on estimation error of all parameters. Interestingly the sample complexity of our estimator translates to conditions on both per-group sample sizes and the total number of samples. We propose an iterative estimation algorithm with linear convergence rate and supplement our theoretical analysis with synthetic and real experimental results. Particularly, we show the predictive power of data enriched model along with its interpretable results in anticancer drug sensitivity analysis.},

  abstract = {Transcription factors and microRNAs (miRNA) both play a critical role in gene regulation and in the development of many diseases such as cancer. Understanding how transcription factors and miRNAs influence gene expression is thus important to understand, but complicated due to the large and interconnected nature of the human genome. To help better understand what genes are being regulated by transcription factors and/or miRNAs we looked at it over 8000 patient samples from 32 different cancer types collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We started by clustering the transcription factors and miRNAs using Thresher to reduce the number of features. Using both the mRNA and miRNA sequencing data we constructed linear models to calculate the coefficient of determination (R2) for each mRNA based on the Thresher cluster expression. We generated three types of linear models: transcription factor, miRNA and transcription factor plus miRNA. We then determined genes that were highly explained or poorly explained by each of the three models based on the genes R2 value. We performed downstream gene enrichment analysis using ToppGene on the sets of well and poorly explained genes. This identified differences in gene regulation between transcription factors and miRNAs and showed what groups of gene are differentially regulated.},
