  abstract = {The transcriptome, or gene expression profile, of a tumor contains detailed information about the disease. Although advances in sequencing tech-nologies have generated larger and more infor-mative data sets, there are still many questions about how the transcriptome is regulated. One class of regulatory elements consists of micro-RNAs (or miRs), many of which are known to be associated with cancer. To better understand the relationships between microRNAs and differ-ent cancers, we analyzed ~9000 samples from 32 cancer types studies in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Using the Thresher R package to per-form feature reduction, we found evidence for 21 biologically interpretable clusters of miRs. Many of these clusters were statistically associated with a specific type of cancer. Moreover, the clusters contain sufficient information to distinguish be-tween most types of cancer. We then used linear models to measure, genome-wide, how much vari-ation in gene expression could be explained by the 21 average expression values (“score”) of the clus-ters. Based on the ~20,000 per-gene R2 values, we found that (a) mean differences between can-cer types explain about 40% of variation; (b) the 21 miR cluster scores explain about 30% of varia-tion, and (c) combining cancer type with the miR scores explained about 56% of the total genome-wide variation in gene expression. Our analysis of poorly explained genes shows that they are en-riched for olfactory receptor processes, sensory perception and nervous system processing which are necessary to receive and interpret signals from outside the organism. Therefore, it is reasonable for those genes to be always active and not get down-regulated by miRs. In contrast, highly ex-plained genes are characterized by genes trans-lating to proteins necessary for transport, plasma membrane, or metabolic processes that are heav-ily regulated processes inside the cell. The dis-tribution of R2 values suggests that other genetic regulatory elements such as transcription factors (TF) and methylation would help explain some of the remaining variation in gene expression. By building a combined microRNA-TF-methylation model, we can potentially predict the majority of human transcriptomic expression.},

             Case Studies: A Tutorial",
  author  = "Cho, Min Ho* and Asiaee*, Amir and Kurtek, Sebastian",
  abstract = { We describe a recent framework for statistical shape analysis of curves and show its applicability to various biological datasets. The presented methods are based on a functional representation of shape called the square-root velocity function and a closely related elastic metric. The main benefit of this approach is its invariance to reparameterization (in addition to the standard shape-preserving transformations of translation, rotation and scale), and ability to compute optimal registrations (point correspondences) across objects. Building upon the defined distance between shapes, we additionally describe tools for computing sample statistics including the mean and covariance. Based on the covariance structure, one can also explore variability in shape samples via principal component analysis. Finally, the estimated mean and covariance can be used to define Wrapped Gaussian models on the shape space, which are easy to sample from. We present multiple case studies on various biological datasets including (1) leaf outlines, (2) internal carotid arteries, (3) Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging fiber tracts, (4) Glioblastoma Multiforme tumors, and (5) vertebrae in mice. We additionally provide a MATLAB package that can be used to produce the results given in this manuscript.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Transcription factors are essential regulators of gene expression and play critical roles in development, differentiation, and in many cancers. To carry out their regulatory programs, they must cooperate in networks and bind simultaneously to sites in promoter or enhancer regions of genes. We hypothesize that the mRNA co-expression patterns of transcription factors can be used both to learn how they cooperate in networks and to distinguish between cancer types. RESULTS: We recently developed a new algorithm, Thresher, that combines principal component analysis, outlier filtering, and von Mises-Fisher mixture models to cluster genes (in this case, transcription factors) based on expression, determining the optimal number of clusters in the process. We applied Thresher to the RNA-Seq expression data of 486 transcription factors from more than 10,000 samples of 33 kinds of cancer studied in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We found that 30 clusters of transcription factors from a 29-dimensional principal component space were able to distinguish between most cancer types, and could separate tumor samples from normal controls. Moreover, each cluster of transcription factors could be either (i) linked to a tissue-specific expression pattern or (ii) associated with a fundamental biological process such as cell cycle, angiogenesis, apoptosis, or cytoskeleton. Clusters of the second type were more likely also to be associated with embryonically lethal mouse phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Using our approach, we have shown that the mRNA expression patterns of transcription factors contain most of the information needed to distinguish different cancer types. The Thresher method is capable of discovering biologically interpretable clusters of genes. It can potentially be applied to other gene sets, such as signaling pathways, to decompose them into simpler, yet biologically meaningful, components.},
