            <p style="text-align:left">I know it seems a bit ridiculous to include a project from when I was 12 years old in this portfolio, but I always thought this project was pretty fun.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left">Basically, my tiny 7th grade self wanted to figure out the science behind trick shots in pool, so I could improve my game (because as a 12-year-old I was obviously very involved in the professional pool circuit).  Conveniently, my dad worked for a robotics company (<a class="active" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omron_Adept" target="_blank">Adept Technology</a>) and brought me home an Adept Cobra i800 4-axis robot.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left">When you hit the cue ball at an angle with respect to the object ball, you create cut-induced throw on the object ball, causing the object ball to travel tangent to the impact line.  When you hit the cue ball with a clockwise or counterclockwise spin (accomplished by hitting the cue ball off center), you create spin-induced throw on the object ball, and the sliding friction propels the object ball to throw left or right (for clockwise or counterclockwise spin respectively).  In my experiment, I attached a cue ball to the robot so I could hit an object ball with cut, spin, and a combination of both.  Using simple trigonometry, I predicted the object ball's trajectory in each shot.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left">The results?  I'm now marginally better at pool.  And there are permanent scuffs in my parents' pool table from robotic abuse.</p>
