# Hey!  Iâ€™m Holly.

I'm currently pursuing a PhD in computer science [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) under [Ben Recht](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/). Previously, I earned my Bachelor's in electrical engineering and computer science from [MIT](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) and my Master's in human rights studies from [Columbia University](https://www.humanrightscolumbia.org/education/graduate/human-rights-studies-ma).

I work on interdisciplinary applications of computer science, from astrophysics to history to political problems.  I'm interested in inverse problems, computational geometry, physics-based simulation, evolutionary algorithms, numerical modeling, and data science.

My previous work includes quantitatively analyzing [a history of anti-Palestinian bias](https://web.mit.edu/hjackson/www/The_NYT_Distorts_the_Palestinian_Struggle.pdf) in *The New York Times* using machine learning methods and co-developing [an algorithm to virtually read and unfold CT scans of sealed historical letters](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/science/locked-letters-unfolding.html).  I have worked at Diego Portales University (Santiago, Chile) building [a family tree of stars](https://news.mit.edu/2020/qa-holly-jackson-building-cosmic-family-tree-1214) in the Milky Way and at NASA Ames Research Center [designing lightweight modular truss structures](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/techbyteswt17_4.pdf#page=7).  I have also worked at Adobe Research and in several MIT labs on machine learning and computer graphics applications. 

Please enjoy this evolving portfolio of some my smaller and larger projects!  Feel free to shoot me an email at [holly_jackson@berkeley.edu](mailto:holly_jackson@berkeley.edu).  You can also check out [my CV](/files/HollyJackson_CV.pdf).
