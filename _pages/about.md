# Hey!  Iâ€™m Holly.

I'm a first-year PhD student in computer science at [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Ben Recht](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/).  Previously, I received my Bachelor's in electrical engineering and computer science from [MIT](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) and my Master's in human rights studies from [Columbia University](https://www.humanrightscolumbia.org/education/graduate/human-rights-studies-ma).

I work on on interdisciplinary applications of computer science, from astrophysics to history to politics.  In the past, I've revealed the [hidden text and structure of 300-year-old sealed historical documents](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/science/locked-letters-unfolding.html) and [built a family tree of the stars](https://news.mit.edu/2020/qa-holly-jackson-building-cosmic-family-tree-1214) in our Milky Way based on their chemical signatures.  I've [designed lightweight modular truss structures at NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/techbyteswt17_4.pdf#page=7) and helped build the [first benchmark for co-evolving design and control in soft robots](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/evolution-gym-sculpts-novel-robot-bodies-and-brains/).  At the other end of my research, I have produced multiple large-scale studies that quantatively analyze [anti-Palestinian bias](https://web.mit.edu/hjackson/www/The_NYT_Distorts_the_Palestinian_Struggle.pdf) in major American media outlets such as *The New York Times*, *The Washington Post*, and *The Wall Street Journal*, and I've catalogued how the Israeli government has spent millions of dollars in an attempt to [influence and suppress student opinion on US college campuses](http://www.holly-jackson.com/files/MAThesis_HollyJackson.pdf).  My research has been featured in over 100 media outlets and has been liked and shared tens of thousands of times on social of media.

<!-- I work on interdisciplinary applications of computer science, from astrophysics to history to political problems.  I'm interested in inverse problems, computational geometry, physics-based simulation, evolutionary algorithms, numerical modeling, and data science. -->

<!-- My previous work includes quantitatively analyzing [a history of anti-Palestinian bias](https://web.mit.edu/hjackson/www/The_NYT_Distorts_the_Palestinian_Struggle.pdf) in *The New York Times* using machine learning methods and co-developing [an algorithm to virtually read and unfold CT scans of sealed historical letters](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/science/locked-letters-unfolding.html).  I have worked at Diego Portales University (Santiago, Chile) building [a family tree of stars](https://news.mit.edu/2020/qa-holly-jackson-building-cosmic-family-tree-1214) in the Milky Way and at NASA Ames Research Center [designing lightweight modular truss structures](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/techbyteswt17_4.pdf#page=7).  I have also worked at Adobe Research and in several MIT labs on machine learning and computer graphics applications.  -->

Please enjoy this evolving portfolio of some my smaller and larger projects!  Feel free to shoot me an email at [holly_jackson@berkeley.edu](mailto:holly_jackson@berkeley.edu).  You can also check out [my CV](/files/HollyJackson_CV.pdf).
